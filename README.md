## Guide to the Artifacts
This guide provides information on how we used the artifacts during the experiments and post-processing of the results.
First, we initiate the 12 hour experiment with configuration variety using repairer.sh script.
The script will take a random start and end date and an arbitrary syzkaller configuration file taken from syzbot dashboard
It will collect all the commit IDs belonging to the interval between start and end dates.
Next up, it will check the commit IDs one by one against the configuration file with koverage to see if the configuration file includes lines in the patch commit.
If not, klocalizer will be used to repair the configuration file to include those lines.
Then, a kernel image will be built with the repaired configuration file and syzkaller will start fuzzing the image for 12 hours.

The same 12 hour experiment will be conducted without configuration variety using original syzkaller configurations using fuzzing_syzkaller_default.sh script.

Next, we will use the scripts to post-process the results of the experiments.

In the beginning, we analyze crash folders of each run of fuzzing with and without configuraiton variety to check whether previously-unreported bugs are present and needs to be reported to the Linux kernel mailing list.

To check whether a bug is previously-unreported we manually analyze the bug's alarm name and call trace and compare it with the existing bug reports with the same description in the Linux kernel mailing list.

If the bug is previously-unreported, we report it to the Linux kernel mailing list.
To report the bug, we use the following steps:
1. We first determine at what source file the bug occurred from the syzkaller bug report.
2. Next, we provide the file name to the script called ./scripts/get_mainter.pl to obtain email addresses of the maintainers of the file.
3. Then, we generate a bug report and include head commit ID of the linux-next version we fuzzed, link to the kernel configuration file used to build the kernel, a reproducer file (if exists) to reproduce the crash and syzkaller bug report of the crash.

find_reproducers.sh can be used to find reproducers of the crashes found during the aforementioned experiment, fuzzing with and without configuration variety.
Reproducers are necessary to be included in the bug reports as they help the maintainers to analyze the crash.
They are also useful to check whether the crash is reproducible on the kernel built with the original syzkaller configuration files.

To be able to check that, we use collect_reproducers.sh to sort reproducers based on their type (C or syz programs) and then manually upload them to kernel emulated with QEMU to see if they crash.

We also use build_kernel.sh script to build kernel images based on provided set of configuration files and commit tags to checkout to.

We also analyze whether the crash is the result of configuration option changes our tool made while repairing the syzkaller configuration file.
For instance, we used ifdef_find_bug_relevance.py to check whether configuration options related to files that contain definitions of functions found in the call trace of a bug's syzkaller report or configuration options related to conditional blocks that may cover the call of those functions exist in configuration files with and without configuration variety.

If there are configuration options that exists in the repaired configuration and not in original syzkaller configuration and if that option caused a source file that contained the definition of a function found in the call trace of the bug to be included, or it caused an \#ifdef conditional block to that covered the call of the function to be included, we consider that our changes led to the crash.

In addition, we instrumented reproducer files generated by syzkaller to have KCOV visibility in order to get program counters executed by the reproducer.
We later convert those program counters to source code lines and check if those lines existed inside of an \#ifdef conditional block that turned true with our modification to a configuration option, with the help of addr2line_inside_ifdef.py.

We also analyze and deduplicate the alarms found during the experiments with and without configuration variety using the scripts find_unique_crash.py and bugs_unique_and_common.py.
With the help of these scripts we also check the bugs found that are unique to each experiment and the bugs that are common to both experiments.
These results can be found in data_tables/GUILD-SYZKALLER Deduplicated Crash name+Trace(Bug Finding+Coverage).xlsx and data_tables/GUILD-SYZKALLER Only Crash+Call Trace(Bug Finding+Coverage).xlsx.

Overall, more information about the experiments and the results can be found in data_tables/Table_of_all_crashes.xlsx.

### Replication Study
We also performed replication study for configuration files used by kernel fuzzers syzkaller and kAFL and repaired configuration files. We used syz-kconf utility to generate syzkaller configuration files for each commit ID and then used koverage tool from kmax tool suite to see whether there are lines from the patch commit that are excluded in syzkaller configuration file, and if yes, we used klocalizer tool from kmax to "repair" the syzkaller config to include those lines as well.
We performed the same set of steps for kAFL configuration file. We took the [configuration file](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kafl.targets/blob/master/linux-kernel/config.vanilla.virtio) mentioned in the [kAFL tutorial](https://intellabs.github.io/kAFL/tutorials/linux/fuzzing_linux_kernel.html#configure-and-build-target-kernel).
We measured how much of a  patch coverage increase is achieved by the repaired configuration file compared to the original Syzkaller and kAFL configuration files using calculate_confidence_intervals.py script.
Moreover, we plotted bar chart of the results of the replication experiment using calculate_confidence_intervals.py. We divided datasets for pairs of Syzkaller and repaired Syzkaller configuration files, kAFL and repaired kAFL configuration files, defconfig and repaired defconfig configuration files into three bar groups.
You can view Figure(Average patch coverage of syzkaller, kAFL, and defconfig.) to see the results of the replication study.
Patch coverage results of the replication study for each dataset are stored in syzkaller_config_patchcoverage.txt, krepair_patchcoverage.txt, kafl_config_patchcoverage.txt, kafl_krepair_patchcoverage.txt, defconfig_config_patchcoverage.txt, defconfig_krepair_patchcoverage.txt files.
All results of the replication study are stored in: #TODO add zenodo link

### Change Summary Study

We evaluated how our approach changed the number of configuration options of original Syzkaller configuration files used in the experiments.
krepair_syzkaller_evaluation/change_summary_2.sh script was used to evaluate the change in  number of configuration options of repaired Syzkaller configuration files against the total number of the configuration options available on the configuration system. The number of total configuration options was obtained from the configuration system of the Linux kernel using find_total_config_option_count.sh script. The csv file that contains the names of original and repaired Syzkaller configuration, and patch commits that are used to repair the original configuration files can be found at change_of_summaries_bug_finding_coverage.csv The csv file that contains the names of original and repaired Syzkaller configuration, and patch commits that are used to repair the original configuration files is change_of_summaries_bug_finding_coverage.csv.
We calculated change of summary percentile information and represented them in a table. You can view Table() to see the results of the change summary study.

### Bootability Study

We evaluated the bootability of the kernel images built with the configuration files generated by utilities like allyesconfig, allnoconfig, and randconfig.
We generated 100 configuration files with randconfig utility, providing it random seed of epoch time via KCONFIG_SEED environment variable, and also provided probability of a configuration option to be enabled with 50% probability via KCONFIG_PROBABILITY environment variable. We used linux-next version v6.7 to compile the configuration fies with. test_100_randconfigs.py script was used to generate configuration files with randconfig, build kernel images with them, and try to boot the kernel images with QEMU. We observed that 100% of the kernel images built with the configuration files generated by randconfig utility were not bootable. You can view the results of the bootability study in randconfig_experiment_results_1710910573.csv file.
Furthermore, we generated kernel images using configuration files generated by allyesconfig and allnoconfig utilities on linux-next version v6.7. We observed that neither the kernel image built with allyesconfig configuration file nor the kernel image built with allnoconfig configuration file was bootable.
